## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend Only**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **No Dependencies**: No external libraries or frameworks required
- **Local Storage**: Uses browser memory (not persistent between sessions)

### File Handling

- Uses FileReader API to convert files to Base64 data URLs
- Stores media in JavaScript arrays during session
- No server upload - everything runs client-side

### Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading with infinite scroll
- CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Masonry layout with CSS columns

### Responsive Breakpoints

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Mobile styles */
  .gallery { column-width: 200px; }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CSS styles              # Glassmorphism design + responsive layout
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ JavaScript logic        # Authentication + file handling + gallery management
```
